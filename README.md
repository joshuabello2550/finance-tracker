# Finance Tracker

Finance Tracker is a small web app for importing credit card transactions into a Google Sheets budget.
It lets you upload a CSV statement (currently formatted for Elan Financial Services), previews the
purchase transactions, then sends them to the API for categorization and insertion into the sheet.

## Purpose
- Reduce manual data entry by importing statement CSVs.
- Automatically categorize transactions before they land in the budget sheet.
- Keep a single Google Sheets spreadsheet as the source of truth.
